centos7: setupATLAS is python3 environment by default (same as setupATLAS -3).
         If you need the previous python2 environment, do setupATLAS -2.
 	 We strongly encourage API users to migrate their scripts to python3.

 Setting up [4mroot 6.22.00-python3-x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt[0m ... 
  ROOT is from lcgenv -p LCG_98python3_ATLAS_1 x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt ROOT
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Information for user <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 root:
   Tip for _this_ standalone ROOT and grid (ie prun) submission:
    avoid --athenaTag if you do not need athena
    use --rootVer=6.22.00-python3 --cmtConfig=x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt
 root:
   Note this ROOT from lcgenv sets up a long list of library paths.
   This may slow down executables; they look at each library path item.
   A faster alternative - setup the entire LCG stack with views:
    lsetup "views LCG_98python3_ATLAS_1 x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt"
